Comparing the east and west coasts' climates through time using ARIMA models

Abstract

Utah State University has made available the climate data for all US monitoring stations under the National Weather Service’s Cooperative Observer Program. This study makes use of the maximum daily temperatures recorded at these stations in order to compare the United States’ coastal climates through time. The rationale behind this aim is to see what affect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans have on the US climate. Temperatures are taken from the States of Washington, Oregon, California, Maine, Virginia and Florida over a period of nine years (2000 – 2008).

Two analyses were conducted. First an exploratory analysis was conducted which consisted of basic statistical tests such as t-tests and F-tests. The second analysis utilised time series methods. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models were fitted to the temperature data of each State.
The results were mostly inconclusive due to the small sample size used in this study. However the analyses did suggest that the East Coast had a much more varied climate than the West Coast. It is believed that this is possibly due to the Gulf Stream’s changing nature as it heads northward along the East Coast.
